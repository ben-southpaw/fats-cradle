# Project Fundamentals

1. Use bun instead of node
2. Use Svelte features where applicable
3. Don't add unprompted new styles or features
4. Break down large tasks into smaller tasks
5. If a better way is available, suggest it but don't assume
6. If you don't know how to do something, ask
7. Read all .md docs for project context

## Documentation and Context

8. Review PROJECT.md for overall architecture and goals
9. Check gotchas.md for implementation details and learnings
10. Verify existing variable usage before suggesting new ones
11. Consider full component context before suggesting changes

## Change Management

12. Never make design decisions without explicit consent
13. Present improvements as suggestions, not actions
14. Wait for approval before implementing any changes
15. Document approved changes in appropriate .md files

## Development Process

16. Check for existing implementations before suggesting new ones
17. Maintain existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change
18. Keep track of related files and their dependencies
19. Document any new learnings or gotchas immediately
20. Ensure backward compatibility unless specified otherwise

## Communication

21. Be explicit about potential impacts of suggested changes
22. Highlight dependencies and relationships between components
23. Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear
24. Provide rationale for improvement suggestions
25. Keep responses focused on the current task
